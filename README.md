# Unity 3d Model Showcase

This is a simple and fast solution to displaying 3d models for various needs. Some common needs that I have:

- Turntables recorded for YouTube
- Screenshots for game mods. 
- Unity Asset store. 

It installs with Cinemachine as a dependency. We use HDR maps to achieve the high-quality product shot render with minimal effort.
